# ✅ Issues Fixed - Ready to Test!

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Backend Dependencies Fixed
- Installed `beanie`, `motor`, `pymongo`
- Updated `requirements.txt`
- Backend now starts successfully

### 2. ✅ Text Visibility Fixed
- Disabled dark mode in `globals.css`
- Added explicit text colors to all inputs:
  - `text-gray-900` (black text)
  - `bg-white` (white background)
- Fixed dropdown/select options visibility

### 3. ✅ API Endpoint Fixed
- Changed frontend API call from `/api/plans/generate` → `/api/plans`
- Matches backend endpoint correctly

### 4. ✅ NextAuth Errors Fixed
- Removed `SessionProvider` wrapper
- Removed API rewrites that were causing auth conflicts
- Cleaned up Next.js config

### 5. ✅ Async/Await Error Fixed
- **Error:** `object LLMPlanResponse can't be used in 'await' expression`
- **Fix:** Removed `await` from `llm_service.generate_plan()` call
- The LLM service is synchronous, not async
- Backend will auto-reload with the fix

### 6. ✅ Gemini API Model Fixed
- **Error:** `404 models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta`
- **Fix:** Changed model from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-pro`
- Updated `backend/config.py`
- Backend needs restart to apply this change

### 7. ✅ Dict vs Object Attribute Error Fixed
- **Error:** `'dict' object has no attribute 'id'`
- **Root Cause:** Gemini API returns JSON that gets parsed differently than expected
- **Fix:** Updated `backend/main.py` to handle both dict and Pydantic model formats
- Added flexible parsing: checks if task is dict or object, accesses data accordingly
- Added debug logging to track response format
- Backend will auto-reload with the fix

### 8. ✅ Type Mismatch in assign_dates Fixed
- **Error:** 500 Internal Server Error after processing tasks
- **Root Cause:** `assign_dates()` expects `TaskResponse` objects but was receiving dictionaries
- **Fix:** Convert dictionaries to `TaskResponse` objects before calling `assign_dates()`
- Convert back to dictionaries after date assignment
- Also fixed `calculate_critical_path()` to use TaskResponse objects
- Backend will auto-reload with the fix

### 9. ✅ Gemini Model Updated to 2.5-flash
- **Error:** 404 for `gemini-pro` and `gemini-1.5-flash` models
- **Root Cause:** Older model names not available in current API
- **Fix:** Updated to `gemini-2.5-flash` (latest stable fast model)
- Increased `max_output_tokens` from 4096 to 8192 to prevent truncation
- Added `response_mime_type="application/json"` to force JSON responses
- **Result:** ✅ Now generating real AI plans with 8-15 tasks!

### 10. ✅ UI/UX Improvements
- **Issue:** Plans not showing immediately after creation
- **Fix:** Added `refetch()` after plan creation to update plans list
- Auto-select newly created plan to show it immediately
- Fixed type mismatch: Updated `PlanGenerateResponse` to match backend response
- Fixed cache key: Changed from `data.plan_id` to `data.id`

- **Issue:** Plan summary displayed as single paragraph (hard to read)
- **Fix:** Format summary into multiple paragraphs for better readability
- Split sentences into logical groups with proper spacing

- **Issue:** Task completion toggle using wrong HTTP method
- **Fix:** Changed from PUT to PATCH to match backend API
- Now properly sends both `is_completed` and `status` fields
- Task completion status updates correctly

## 🧪 Test It!

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:3000
2. **Enter a goal:** "Build a REST API for task management"
3. **Select plan type:** Should see options clearly
4. **Click Generate Plan**
5. **Wait 3-5 seconds** for AI to generate
6. **View your plan!** Should see task cards
